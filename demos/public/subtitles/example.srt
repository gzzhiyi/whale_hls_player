1
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:20,133
hey folks this is Chris lofflin

2
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:22,766
I'm here doing music series

3
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:23,533
and today

4
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:25,799
we're going to talk about some contemporary RMV

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,800
and neo soul bass playing

6
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:31,066
so get your base and let's play some soul music

7
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,333
hey folk so that was kind of an example of

8
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,766
a track that you might hear and is considered to be

9
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,133
contemporary R m B

10
00:01:14,133 --> 00:01:15,999
or even neo soul

11
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,899
the term neo soul is actually more of an

12
00:01:19,366 --> 00:01:22,533
industry term that it actually is a musical one

13
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,700
it's it kind of categorizes the music of

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,366
mid 90s early 2 thousands

15
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,500
artists like the Angelo and America badu and Maxwell

16
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,300
and

17
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,533
those kinds of folks

18
00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:38,999
when they 1st got started their sound was

19
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,733
a lot different than

20
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:44,399
some of the other music that was popular at the time

21
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,400
and they went back to

22
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,666
really soulful singing they went back to

23
00:01:51,566 --> 00:01:53,866
really warm sounds and things

24
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:55,799
and it reminded everybody of

25
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,300
the music that happened in the 70s and the 60s and

26
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:02,866
uh that's kind of how they wanted to call it

27
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:04,933
neo soul new soul

28
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:07,966
but it had all the same traditions as those

29
00:02:07,966 --> 00:02:09,999
but it added some influences too

30
00:02:10,266 --> 00:02:12,599
it added uh electronic music

31
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,933
it added hip hop was a huge influence

32
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:19,299
uh reggae African music Latin musics

33
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,466
um even lots of different forms of rock music

34
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,533
so it was just a culmination of

35
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:27,333
of all of the music that

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,566
those people grew up listening to

37
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,800
and they just made really warm

38
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,166
soulful sounding music out of it

39
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:37,466
um

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
there's definitely a a

41
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:42,866
a way to approach playing this music

42
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,900
uh the drums are

43
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:47,533
probably the biggest influence

44
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:49,299
that you'll have in this music

45
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:53,299
unlike say some forms of rock or even some

46
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,100
forms of funk music where um

47
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,933
the baseline is really prevalent

48
00:02:59,066 --> 00:03:01,399
the drums are kind of what

49
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,599
everything is based on

50
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,800
so we listen to those and we play along with those

51
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,100
following those a lot of times

52
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,466
and there's a couple different ways of approaching

53
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:15,733
making baselines for this stuff

54
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,300
or even playing the baselines that are on the records

55
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,533
so what I like to do is

56
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,800
kind of put on a track and us listen to

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,533
maybe some things that we could listen for and

58
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:30,299
and actually some scales and things that we can use

59
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,533
all of that good stuff

60
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:33,899
so let's get started

61
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,900
so the 1st thing I want us to do is listen to the drums

62
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:42,366
and one thing that I like to do to get started is

63
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:45,333
listen to the kick drum especially

64
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,900
and follow that

65
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,966
now we have 2 choices

66
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,900
we can

67
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,300
play the rhythms that they're playing

68
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,333
and play long notes

69
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,100
or play short notes

70
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,100
okay

71
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,700
so the demonstration of playing long notes

72
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,733
let the note ring out

73
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:10,333
or we can play them short

74
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,899
both is a different feeling

75
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,466
we play it like this is

76
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:21,699
actually sounds more like the kick drum

77
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,566
or we can mix the 2

78
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:35,699
right now what you want to make sure that you have

79
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,300
is you have a really nice tone

80
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:40,466
now I'm playing it with my thumbs

81
00:04:40,466 --> 00:04:42,266
it's actually called a thumb you

82
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,066
and what I'm doing is is with my right hand I'm just

83
00:04:49,566 --> 00:04:50,399
instead of

84
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:55,333
see how that's a little bit more bright

85
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,799
has a little bit more of an edge

86
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,533
it's a little bit warmer

87
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:03,333
a little bit more dull

88
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:12,366
you want to actually

89
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:14,333
think like a drummer when you're playing this

90
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,600
now I'm playing over a C

91
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:24,666
once again one note baseline

92
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,533
and it's great

93
00:05:29,733 --> 00:05:33,533
what I'm gonna do here is kind of um

94
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:37,099
introduce maybe some

95
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,200
some different notes or

96
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,600
different scales that we can use

97
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:40,733
now

98
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,933
the track itself has a keyboard part

99
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:46,133
and the course that

100
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:49,133
it'll play is actually is going to be 2 different

101
00:05:49,466 --> 00:05:51,933
C chords it's gonna play a C minor chord

102
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:54,566
and it's gonna play a C major chord

103
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:57,933
so what we can do with both of those

104
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:01,966
is we can play in that box that we were talking about

105
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:05,166
so if I play in this box I'm playing

106
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:09,366
the root again I'm playing the 5th

107
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:12,066
and I'm also playing the octave

108
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,733
and I can use those notes

109
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,533
now they'll work over both chords

110
00:06:21,566 --> 00:06:25,366
so what I like to do down is um

111
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,200
for that

112
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:28,966
last demonstration I just use one note

113
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,899
what we're gonna do now is

114
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:32,666
I'm gonna do some other notes

115
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,666
maybe some different scales that we can use

116
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:37,466
over the chords that will be playing over

117
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,000
so the 1st thing I wanna do is

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,566
reintroduce the box

119
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:46,766
us playing the root the 5th and the octave

120
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:48,133
so that's the root

121
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,466
that's the 5th

122
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:51,099
and that's the octave

123
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,600
that'll completely work over

124
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,333
both of the chords that we're going to play

125
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:00,066
but now what we're going to do is we're going to get

126
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:01,599
specific about

127
00:07:02,533 --> 00:07:03,866
the scales that we use

128
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,700
1st one we're going to use is when I spoke about before

129
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,566
and that'll be a major pentatonic

130
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:11,333
so that shape is like this

131
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:20,133
all right so it'll be 24 one 4 one 4

132
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:24,066
now that's the major

133
00:07:24,133 --> 00:07:26,399
we're going to do now is add a minor

134
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,866
so to play the minor

135
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,333
we're going to play

136
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,700
one

137
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:35,466
4 one 3 one

138
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:36,533
3

139
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:41,099
so once again it looks like a box

140
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,100
now those are going to be

141
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,533
specific to the chords that we're going to play to

142
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,333
alright so what I'm going to do now

143
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,533
is I'm going to put the track on

144
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,266
so we can hear the keyboard part

145
00:07:56,366 --> 00:07:57,366
and then we're going to

146
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:58,866
play some base parts

147
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:00,966
that add those notes from those games

148
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:09,399
alright so now we hear keyboard part that 1st chord

149
00:08:09,966 --> 00:08:12,266
is a C minor chord

150
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:14,766
this next chord

151
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,000
is a C major so we can use that box

152
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:22,933
over both

153
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,900
we can play them long

154
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,966
so now what we can do is we can use the specific scales

155
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:47,099
for the specific chords

156
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:48,399
and once again

157
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,166
we'll name the chords

158
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,499
right here is the minor

159
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,399
C minor it's a C major

160
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:57,466
C minor

161
00:09:00,566 --> 00:09:01,466
see major

162
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:04,066
see minor

163
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,400
see major

164
00:09:18,466 --> 00:09:19,266
just

165
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:21,566
alternating between the 2

166
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,533
could be that simple right

167
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,400
those we played a little short

168
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,733
the snake example let's play them a little long

169
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:39,899
right so

170
00:09:39,933 --> 00:09:40,999
hold on to him

171
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:55,466
I'm just

172
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,600
I'm just choosing random notes

173
00:10:03,866 --> 00:10:04,933
but the rhythms of

174
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:08,266
what makes it sound good it makes it feel good

175
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:09,866
alright so

176
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:11,466
just keep practicing those

177
00:10:11,466 --> 00:10:12,666
have fun with it

178
00:10:12,866 --> 00:10:14,966
alternate between long and a short

179
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:28,066
now I'm playing with my thumb all over time

180
00:10:28,066 --> 00:10:29,899
but you can play with your fingers too

181
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,700
sometimes

182
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:39,566
I just have a great time

183
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:47,999
and I'll see you in the next lesson
